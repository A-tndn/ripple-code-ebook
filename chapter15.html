                <div class="simple-explanation">
                    <p>Remember how one stone creates ripples in a pond? Now imagine 100 people throwing stones at the same time! When lots of individual ripples combine, they create <strong>MASSIVE waves</strong> that can change entire communities, schools, and even the world!</p>

                    <div class="amazing-fact">
                        <h3>🧠 Amazing Collective Power!</h3>
                        <p>Scientists found that when just <strong>10% of people</strong> in a group start doing something positive, it can spread to the entire group! This means just <strong>3 kids in a class of 30</strong> can change the whole classroom's mood!</p>
